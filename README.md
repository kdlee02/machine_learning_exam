# Machine Learning Project

1. Write a Python program using numpy to perform specific image processing tasks
on a color image. The tasks include converting a color image to grayscale and performing
image flipping operations.

2. Given a set of noisy data points generated from a polynomial function, your task is to write a
Python program that estimates the optimal degree of the polynomial that best fits the data.
You do not know the original polynomial degree used to generate the data.

3. The Wine dataset comprises 13 features related to the chemical composition of wine and a
target variable indicating the wine cultivar. This dataset is excellent for practicing classification
techniques in machine learning. Implement a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier to
identify the cultivar of a wine based on its chemical attributes. Determine the optimal
number of neighbors for the best classification performance.

4. The Wholesale Customers dataset contains data about customers of a wholesale distributor. It
includes various product spending categories such as Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen,
Detergents_Paper, and Delicatessen. The dataset includes "Channel" and "Region" categories for
customers; however, please disregard these for the purposes of this assignment. This data is
suitable for understanding customer purchase behavior and segmenting customers based on
spending patterns using clustering techniques. You are tasked with analyzing the Wholesale
Customers dataset to identify distinct groups (clusters) of customers based on their annual
spending on different product categories. Use k-means clustering to achieve this
segmentation.
